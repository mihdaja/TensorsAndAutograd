# Tensors and Autograd functions in Pytorch

Using the guide from https://sebastianraschka.com/teaching/pytorch-1h/ i wanted to figure out some of the pytorch functions that will help me build neural networks in the future

In this file, i played around with tensors, figured out how to make them.
I also simulated a neural network with a single neuron and i learned how to automatically calculate the loss and the gradient for the weights and biases using both the grad function and by calling .backward
